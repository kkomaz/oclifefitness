                              <h4>Client Testimonials</h4>
                              <p>I was a little hesitant at first working out with Danny. I was intimidated by his passion and knowledge for what he was doing.  After the first training session, though, I felt completely at ease. He let me go at my own pace, but pushed me when I needed it. He was always very encouraging and easy to talk to. The way that he knew exactly what to do when I described my goal to him was very cementing. I loved working out with him and encourage others to do the same!</p>

                              <h4>Fading Testimonials</h4>
                              <p>I trained with Danny a couple of times, and he is a great personal trainer. He definitely knows what he’s talking about. He tells you what parts of your muscles that you’re working out. He also pushes you to your maximal limits! He pushes you to the furthest you can go without hurting, straining, or pulling anything. He likes to make you feel comfortable in front of him, and he’s even funny too.  He's a great trainer and if you don't hire him then you won't get into shape the way you want. </p>

                              <h4>Fading Testimonials</h4>
                              <p> lost inches off my waist and my arms look better than ever! When I was introduced to Danny, I was a hesitant to try the workout because trainers in the past have never produced me the results I desired. He promised me that the workouts would be different and I was surprised and refreshed to see that it was. He was very easy to talk and comfortable to be around. </p>
